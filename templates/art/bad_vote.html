<h1>Invalid vote</h1>
<p>Your browser submitted a vote of <tt>{{ vote|escape }}</tt>, which is neither <tt>"good"</tt> nor <tt>"bad"</tt>. Most likely, this is because Internet Explorer <a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/wrongWithIE/">doesn't know</a> HTML.</p>
<p>Working around it would be a waste of my time.</p>
